This repository is a central file storage location which provides a structured way for programmers to store development files.
A repository can be on a local machine for an individual user or it can be located on a server so it can be accessed by multiple users.
This repository will enable me to store files that I am working on for assignments and manage them in a convenient and structured manner and sort them in trunks or branches
